## Theory
•	The NE555 timer is a widely used integrated circuit for generating precise time delays and oscillations. When operated in astable mode, it functions as a free-running oscillator that continuously produces a square wave without any external triggering signal. In this mode, a capacitor connected to the circuit charges through resistors R1 and R2 and discharges through R2 repeatedly. The internal voltage divider of the 555 timer creates two reference levels at 1/3 Vcc and 2/3 Vcc. 
•	When the capacitor voltage reaches 2/3 Vcc, the upper comparator resets the flip-flop and turns ON the discharge transistor, causing the capacitor to discharge. When the voltage falls to 1/3 Vcc, the lower comparator sets the flip-flop, turning OFF the discharge transistor and allowing the capacitor to charge again. This continuous charging and discharging process generates a square wave at the output (Pin 3) and an exponential waveform across the capacitor. The time period of oscillation is given by T=0.693(R1+2R2)CT = 0.693 (R1 + 2R2) CT=0.693(R1+2R2)C, and the frequency depends on the values of R1, R2, and C. Thus, the 555 timer in astable mode acts as a simple and reliable square wave generator used in clock circuits, LED flashers, and pulse generation applications.
